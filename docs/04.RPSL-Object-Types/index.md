# RPSL Object Types

In this section, the various object types in the RIPE Database are described. Each object represents information related to an Internet resource or a supporting or administrative function.

For each object type, a template defines the attributes that are permitted. The properties of these attributes are also shown, as they apply within that specific object type. Each template is followed by descriptive text explaining the purpose and use of the included attributes.

For more detailed information about attribute properties, see [Attribute Properties](../RIPE-Database-Structure/Attribute-Properties#attribute-properties).

These templates are used by the software to perform syntax validation. To avoid confusion, the documentation reflects the templates as they are applied by the software, without introducing significant differences in structure or interpretation.
