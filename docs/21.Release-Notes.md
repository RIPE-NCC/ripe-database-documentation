[Archive of Older Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/master/changes.txt)


## Release Candidate Environment

**The Release Candidate environment contains the upcoming release of the database software with a dummified snapshot of the production data. The dummification is only applied to personal data. This environment makes it possible for you to test your software with upcoming versions of the RIPE Database.**

### Information About Services

| **Service**     | **Location**                       |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| command line    | whois-rc.ripe.net, port 43         |
| syncupdates     | https://syncupdates-rc.db.ripe.net |
| REST API        | https://rest-rc.db.ripe.net        |
| RDAP API        | https://rdap-rc.db.ripe.net        |
| web application | https://rc.db.ripe.net             |
| mailupdates     | rc-dbm@ripe.net                    |

### Differences From Live RIPE Database

* For each **mntner** object in the Release Candidate database, the passwords have been set to the object id.
For example, the object:

inetnum: 193.0.0.0 - 103.0.7.255
...
mnt-by: ninja-mnt
...
can be changed by supplying the password: ninja-mnt. Regardless of the passwords used in the live RIPE Database, in the Release Candidate database they have been adjusted to reflect the **mntner** id.

* The databases are snapshots of live RIPE Database data, dummified in the beginning of each new testing period. Personal data is replaced during the dummification process.
* No emails are sent from the Release Candidate system. This means no response from mailupdates submissions to the Release Candidate database, no ack or notify emails are sent by the Release Candidate database.

### Notes

As in the live RIPE Database, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are active. Even though the personal data in the Release Candidate database is dummified, ACLs are active to ensure it operates in the same way as the production system.

Even though the Release Candidate database contains snapshot of the live data from the start of the testing period, no changes made to the Release Candidate database will have any impact on the live RIPE Database data. The two are completely separated.

Any scripts or automated processes you use to maintain your data in the RIPE Database can be used with the Release Candidate database - simple adjust the URLs accordingly. The whole purpose is to allow you to test your processes as closely as possible to the action RIPE Database using newly developed and released software.
