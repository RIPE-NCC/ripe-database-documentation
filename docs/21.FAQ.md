## Why did I receive an Error 201: Access Denied?

There are several cases when this might occur. Please see below for the one which applies to your situation:

* You (or your application) performed too many queries that returned contact information (e.g. person or role objects) from the RIPE Database. There is a daily limit on the amount of personal data returned as described in the [Acceptable Use Policy](23.RIPE-Database-Acceptable-Use-Policy.md).
* Even if you queried for other types of objects, the associated contact information is returned by default. To avoid this situation please use the "-r" flag to prevent any associated contact information from being returned.
* You used a proxy server to access the RIPE Database (such as a third-party web query  interface). In this case, it is likely that the proxy itself was denied access to the database. Please contact then administrators of the server you were using and discuss this situation with them. They may need to contact the RIPE Database administration [ripe-dbm@ripe.net](mailto:ripe-dbm@ripe.net) team to request further access.
* If none of the above describes your situation, please contact the RIPE Database administration team [ripe-dbm@ripe.net](mailto:ripe-dbm@ripe.net) to discuss the problem further.
