# Tagging

The RIPE Database allows system tags to be added to any (group of) objects. This is metadata that gives some additional information or meaning to certain objects. For example, all resource objects maintained by the RIPE NCC are tagged with “RIPE-REGISTRY-RESOURCE”. Other resources created in the database by users that are more specific to objects tagged with “RIPE-REGISTRY-RESOURCE” are tagged with “RIPE-USER-RESOURCE”.

Currently these tags are only generated by the database software and are re-generatednighty.
