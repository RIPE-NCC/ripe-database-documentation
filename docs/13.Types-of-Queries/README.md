# Types of Queries

Throughout this section, the query flags described allow specific types of queries. For command-line queries and for API searches, these flags can be used directly. For web queries, some of the flags can be selected by ticking appropriate check boxes, others can be typed as part of the query string. There are some flags that make no sense with web queries and streamed output, for example “-k” for a persistent connection or “–G” to turn off grouping, as grouping is disabled by default in the streamed output.
