# IRR Toolset Support

The IRRToolset is a third-party suite of routing policy analysis tools. Some of the tools in this set access Routing Registry servers through an authorisation whois interface.

The RIPE Database server includes support for these query types. This section describes the additions to the RIPE Database user interface that allow it to support the IRRToolset. The required queries are:

* Return the prefixes of all **route** and **route6** objects with a specified origin – whois -Ki origin&lt;asn&gt;
* Return only the primary keys of the **route** and **route6** objects, not full objects – whois –KTroute,route6 &lt;prefix&gt;
* Return the prefixes of all **route** and **route6** objects referenced in a given route-set – whois –K &lt;route-set&gt;
* Return all the members (**aut-num** or **as-set** object) of a specified **as-set**. This returns only the "members:" attributes, not the full object – whois –K &lt;as-set&gt;
* Optionally, include support for expansion of the previous query, if the returned value contains references to as-sets, so that the result contains only a list of **aut-num** objects.

The RIPE Database server does not support this and it is up to the client to perform the expansion. The IRRToolset currently does the expansion.

* Return **route** and **route6** objects that exactly match a specified prefix - whois –BGxTroute,route6 193.0.0.0/21
* Return **route** and **route6** objects that exactly match a specified prefix (as above), but return only the "route:" or "route6:" attributes prefix - whois –KxTroute,route6 193.0.0.0/21
