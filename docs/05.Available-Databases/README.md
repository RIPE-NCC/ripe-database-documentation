# Available Databases

An update is the submission of information for entry into, or removal from, a database. As the database records are RPSL objects, these updates create, modify or delete one or more objects.

There are several databases that can be updated and a number of ways in which you can submit an update. Each of the databases described below have a fully operating software system built around them. This includes the core database software as well as the external interfaces, for example email service, Webupdates, Syncupdates and RESTful API.
