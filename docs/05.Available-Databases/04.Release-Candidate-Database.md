# Release Candidate Database (RC)

The release procedure for new software requires the new system to be available in a test environment for a period of time. This test environment is built around the RC Database. This is a fully functioning service where all your client software can be tested against the new software release. The RC database is dummified to remove personal data. Also all **mntner** object authorisation tokens are set to a password using the **mntner** object name. This allows more flexibility, as you can create objects that are only created by the RIPE NCC in the production version, Other than that, it is an exact copy of the production database, with the copy made at some point in time close to the software release date.
