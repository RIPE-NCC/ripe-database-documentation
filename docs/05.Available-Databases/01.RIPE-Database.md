# RIPE Database

The RIPE Database is the authoritative database and is sometimes referred to as the ‘live’ or ‘production’ database or service. This holds all the current data for all the existing RPSL objects. It also holds historical data for deleted objects and previous versions of the current objects. Most operational services and tools are built around this database.
