# Experimental Databases

There are times when some features need to be deployed in a proof of concept mode. It may be an idea that some community users have suggested but does not yet have widespread support. A proof of concept software release can be made and a temporary database, similar to the RC Database, set up to demonstrate the feature. That database will be a full copy of the production database with dummified personal data and modified **mntner** object credentials.

Similar projects may be set up when a major data migration project is proposed. A test run may be carried out on a database copy and this may be made available to the community to review what their data looks like after the change.
