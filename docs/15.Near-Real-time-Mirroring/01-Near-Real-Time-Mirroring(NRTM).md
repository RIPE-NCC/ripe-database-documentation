# Near Real Time Mirroring (NRTM)

**The RIPE NCC NRTM** is a publicly available service that allows authorised users to receive a stream of available data from the RIPE Database on a server. The user will receive a stream of data from the server with near real time updates. This service does not include any personal data.


## How to access the NRTM stream

You will find all technical requirements to access the stream and more information about NRTM [in this document](02-Access-to-NRTM.md#access-to-nrtm).


## Legal Framework

The RIPE NCC NRTM Service and its use is regulated bu the [RIPE Database Terms and Conditions](../21.Terms-And-Conditions.md#ripe-database-terms-and-conditions) and [RIPE Database Acceptable Use Policy](../22.RIPE-Database-Acceptable-Use-Policy.md#ripe-database-acceptable-use-policy).

Transferring and/or making available of the NRTM Service and/or the data downloaded therefrom to a third party is only allowed, provided the following conditions are met:

* The user obtains prior written permission from the RIPE NCC
* The user ensures that third party accepts the [RIPE Database Terms and Conditions](../21.Terms-And-Conditions.md#ripe-database-terms-and-conditions) for this purpose.
* The user identifies the RIPE NCC as the source of the data and will explicitly state that this data is near-real time and may not reflect the latest data contained in the RIPE Database.
* The user maintains the overall integrity of the data (e.g. will not misrepresent, falsify or exlude any data).

The RIPE NCC reserves the right to revoke this permission at any time if the user fails to meet any of these consitions.
