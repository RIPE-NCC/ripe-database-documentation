## IRIS Server Prototype

### Introduction

As part a project to implement the [IRIS protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3981.txt) (also known as CRISP), the RIPE NCC set up a prototype IRIS server for public testing. The server implemented the AREG protocol, and provided live data from the RIPE Database.


### About the Server Software

We set up the prototype server as a proxy in front of the RIPE Database. It was based on the FLowerBed server implementation developer by [VeriSign Labs](http://labs.verisign.com/).

Related code changes were fed back into the main **FlowerBed** code base which was available for download from the project website.


### Web Query Interface

There remains a simple web interface at the following address:

### Perl Client Library

The RIPE NCC developed a prototype Perl client that could be used to make queries to AREG servers. This was not a complete client implementation, but we felt that it was useful for people that wanted to test the service.


### Graphical Client

Pimmit was an IRIS client developed by VeriSign Research. It featured a graphical user interface that supported all registry specific query types.
