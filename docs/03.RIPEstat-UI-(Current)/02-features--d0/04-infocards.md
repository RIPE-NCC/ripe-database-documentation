# Infocards

Infocards are discrete pieces of information about a resource. When grouped together in certain ways, they constitute a particular use case. We have assembled some common use cases for you under the Use Cases menu, but you can also create your own groupings with saved searches.

## Anatomy of an Infocard

Each infocard consists of a titlebar and a content area. The titlebar contains the title as well as close button (on hover) and info button.

### Titlebar

You can use the titlebar to:

- Drag the infocard to another location relative to its sibling cards
- Display or hide info about the card and its data
- Hide the card (when hovering, an "x" will appear that when clicked on will hide the infocard)

### Content area

The main content area will generally show a short summary line about the queried resource. If there is more detailed information, it can be revealed by clicking the more info button. <img src='./images/moreinfo.png' height='30px' style="vertical-align:bottom">
