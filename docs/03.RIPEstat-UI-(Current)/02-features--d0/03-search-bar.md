# Search Bar

The search bar is where you can enter your resource (IP, prefix, ASN, country or hostname) along with date range (in relative or absolute values) and run a query based on those inputs. The lower part of the search bar also contains tools that allow you to share, save, and organise your results.

## Search Input

In this field you can enter your resource (an IP, prefix, ASN, country, or hostname). The box will provide a dropdown with search suggestions based on your input, as well as suggestions based on your local information, such as your IP.


## Date Range Input

The Date Range selector lets you choose from latest or relative timeframes (such as "last 4 weeks") or absolute timeframes by selecting a start date and end date, then being able to refine further the time within that envelope using the time slider.

## Sharing

The Open Share Panel button opens a panel that gives you a link to share that will allow the receiver to perform the same search that you are currently viewing.

## Save Search

The Save Search button brings up a dialog box allowing you to name, describe, and save your particular search (which you can then retrieve from the Saved menu on the left).

## Manage Infocards

The Manage Infocards button reveals a dropdown panel that allows you to filter and order the infocards for your search type. You can show/hide all of them, check or uncheck the boxes to show/hide individual items, or drag them to reorder.
::: tip
In addition to being able to show/hide infocards from this dropdown, you can also reorder items by dragging them, and filter search items by typing in text at the top of the dropdown.
