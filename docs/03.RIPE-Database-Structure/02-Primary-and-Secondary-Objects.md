# Primary and Secondary Objects

Objects in the RIPE Database naturally fall into two categories, primary and secondary.

Primary objects contain operational data. For example **inetnum** and **aut-num** objects hold Internet resource information. Also, **route** and **domain** objects hold details of routing agreements and reverse delegations.

Secondary objects provide supporting and administrative details for primary objects. For example, **person** objects hold contact information for someone related to an Internet resource. Or **organisation** objects hold details of resource holders.
