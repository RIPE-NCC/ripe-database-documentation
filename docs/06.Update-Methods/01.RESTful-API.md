# RIPE Database RESTful API

For more information about the REST paradigm, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer.
All the services are accessible via HTTPS.
Use of the Whois REST API is governed by the RIPE Database [terms and conditions](../Legal-Information/#)

## RESTful URI format

Each object in the RIPE Database has a unique locator URI, in the following format:

https://rest.db.ripe.net/{source}/{objecttype}/{key}

Where:

* `Source` is the database source (e.g. RIPE).
* `Objecttype` is the object type (e.g. inetnum)
* `key` is the primary key(s)
    * Normally key is a single attribute value.
    * Use the `nic-hdl` attribute value for person or role object types.
    * Combine the `route(6)` attribute value and `origin` attribute value for route or route6 object types (e.g. route 193.0.22.0/23AS3333).

|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization | [Basic HTTP Authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617). The Authorisation request header value contains 'Basic' followed by the base64 encoding of the maintainer name and password separated by a colon. |

#### HTTP Request Body

A [WhoisResource](../RIPE-Database-Structure/REST-API-Data-model/#rest-api-data-model) containing the object to be created.

The client should specify the desired response format using the `Accept:` header in the HTTP request. If unspecified, the response defaults to XML.

The HTTP request must include a `Content-Type:` header for POST, PUT and DELETE. The HTTP response will include a `Content-Type:` header, and the response body will be encoded in the requested format.

The possible values that you can specify for the Accept/Content-Type header are:

* `application/xml` for XML
* `application/json` for JSON

Clients can also append an extension of `.xml` or `.json` to the request URL instead of setting an `Accept:` header. The server will return a response in the appropriate format for that given extension.

#### HTTP Response Body

A [WhoisResource](../RIPE-Database-Structure/REST-API-Data-model/#rest-api-data-model) containing the newly created, unfiltered object.


#### HTTP Status Codes
Client applications should use the HTTP status code to detect the result of an operation. Any error messages will be included in the response body (see below).

Possible reasons for various HTTP status codes are as follows:

| code                         | description                                                                                         |

| Too Many Request (429)       | Query limit exceeded.                                                                               |
| Not Found (404)              | No results were found (on a search request), or object specified in URI does not exist.             |
| Method not Allowed (405)     | No results were found (on a search request), or object specified in URI does not exist.             |
| Conflict (409)               | Integrity constraint was violated (e.g. when creating, object already exists).                      |
| Unsupported Media Type (415) | Unsupported/missing value for Accept/Content-Type header.                                           |
| Internal Server Error (500)  | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.      |

#### HTTP Request Body
A [WhoisResource](../RIPE-Database-Structure/REST-API-Data-model/#rest-api-data-model) containing the new version of the specified objects.

The client should specify the desired response format using the `Accept:` header in the HTTP request. If unspecified, the response defaults to XML.

The HTTP request must include a `Content-Type:` header for POST, PUT and DELETE. The HTTP response will include a `Content-Type:` header, and the response body will be encoded in the requested format.

The possible values that you can specify for the Accept/Content-Type header are:

#### HTTP Request Body

The client should specify the desired response format using the `Accept:` header in the HTTP request. If unspecified, the response defaults to XML.

The HTTP request must include a `Content-Type:` header for POST, PUT and DELETE. The HTTP response will include a `Content-Type:` header, and the response body will be encoded in the requested format.

The possible values that you can specify for the Accept/Content-Type header are:

* `application/xml` for XML
* `application/json` for JSON

Clients can also append an extension of `.xml` or `.json` to the request URL instead of setting an `Accept:` header. The server will return a response in the appropriate format for that given extension.

#### HTTP Response Body
A [WhoisResource](../RIPE-Database-Structure/REST-API-Data-model/#rest-api-data-model) containing the (filtered) deleted object.


#### HTTP Status Codes
Client applications should use the HTTP status code to detect the result of an operation. Any error messages will be included in the response body (see below).

Possible reasons for various HTTP status codes are as follows:

| code                         | description                                                                                         |

| Bad request (400)            | Incorrect value for object type or key. The server is unable to understand and process the request. |
| Authentication failure (401) | Incorrect password                                                                                  |
| Forbidden (403)              | Query limit exceeded.                                                                               |
| Too Many Request (429)       | Query limit exceeded.                                                                               |
| Not Found (404)              | No results were found (on a search request), or object specified in URI does not exist.             |
| Method not Allowed (405)     | No results were found (on a search request), or object specified in URI does not exist.             |
| Conflict (409)               | Integrity constraint was violated (e.g. when creating, object already exists).                      |
| Unsupported Media Type (415) | Unsupported/missing value for Accept/Content-Type header.                                           |
| Internal Server Error (500)  | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.      |


### Examples

* Example Request:

    curl -X DELETE 'https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/pp1-ripe?password=123'

* Example Request using Basic authorisation (Basic AA1-TEST:AA1-TEST):

    curl -X DELETE -H 'Authorization: Basic QUExLVRFU1Q6QUExLVRFU1QtUEFTU1dPUkQ=' 'http://rest-test.db.ripe.net/test/person/AA1-TEST'

* Example dry-run requests:

    curl -X PUT --data @form.txt 'https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/TP1-RIPE?dry-run&password=...'

    curl -X PUT --data @form.txt 'https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/TP1-RIPE?dry-run=true&password=...'



## Request / Response Encoding

Please take into account the following points to avoid unexpected encoding behaviour:

* Objects are stored using the latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) character set.
* If the request character set is not latin-1, then the request body is converted to latin-1. A question mark character ('?' or 0x3F) is used as a substitution character, if the character is outside the latin-1 character set.
* The response should contain a warning, if conversion was necessary. [known issue #291](https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/issues/291)
* Unrecognised encodings that cannot be converted to latin-1 will result in an unsuccessful operation.
* To be absolutely certain of what was stored in the database, do a follow-up query.
* The REST API response will be in UTF-8.
* We recommend to use UTF-8 character encoding in all REST API requests, but restrict the content to valid latin-1 characters.



 ## Update latency

It could take up to 10 seconds before an update becomes visible for lookup or search operations. For non-hierarchical object types (person, role, organisation,...), the typical latency is less than 1 second. For hierarchical objects types (inet(6)num, route(6), domain), it is about 3-5 seconds on average, up to 10 seconds maximum.

A way to work around this limitation is to rely on the response of the muting operation in REST API (PUT, POST, DELETE). These all return the object as it appears in the database in their response body after the successful update. This object is never filtered or altered in any way.

Any required passwords must also be supplied as part of the Uniform Resource identifier (URI) using the URI query parameter "password=". One parameter should be used for each password supplied. The pseudo attribute "password:" cannot be used in the HTTP request body. See ["Email Updates"](../Update-Methods/Email-Updates/#email-updates) for more information.


## Client Certificate Authentication

[Client Certificate Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Client_certificate_authentication)
is supported by the Whois REST API. To use the client certificate service, you must have your own certificate: either from a certificate authority (CA) such as Let's Encrypt, or you can generate one yourself.

The **key-cert** object's client certificate status is validated by checking its `notBefore` and `notAfter` dates to ensure it is within its 
designated validity period. This involves comparing the current date against these dates: if the certificate is not yet valid (`notBefore`) 
or has expired (`notAfter`), it is considered invalid and an error is raised. This validation ensures that the certificate is only used within 
its valid time frame, maintaining secure and reliable authentication.

Additionally, signed updates are only considered valid for an hour after they are signed. After that the 
authentication will fail.

### Example

For an example of how to use client certificate authentication, please see the appendix ["Client Certificate Authentication"](../Appendices/Appendix-I--Client-Certificate-Authentication/#introduction). 


## API Key Authentication

API keys are a way to script (automate) authenticated queries and updates using the Whois REST API. They are generated using the web interface and are associated with a user's RIPE NCC Access account. They have a maximum validity of one year.

You can create as many different keys as you’d like. We suggest that you create a separate key for each application that you’d like to provide with access. That way, if you believe the key has been compromised, you can revoke access to that application without affecting other applications that you have provided with access.

API keys created for the RIPE database cannot be used with any other RIPE NCC service.
