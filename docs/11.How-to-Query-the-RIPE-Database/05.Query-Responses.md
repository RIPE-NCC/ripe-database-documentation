# Query Responses

There is a set of general rules that apply to server responses:

* The same response will be returned from the server for all query methods.
* Output lines starting with the % sign are either a server response code or server messages (a comment, information message or an error with description).
* A message contains a white space after the % sign, while a server response code starts right after the % sign. See [Appendix C, RIPE Database Query Server Response Codes and Messages](../Appendices/Appendix-C--RIPE-Database-Query-Server-Response-Codes-and-Messages/#appendix-c--ripe-database-query-server-response-codes-and-messages) for more information. 
* Do not write scripts to parse the messages. The text is subject to change at any time.
* An empty line terminates a database object in the output. This is a line containing only a newline character (\n).
* Two empty lines, each containing only a new-line character (\n), mean the end of a server response.
