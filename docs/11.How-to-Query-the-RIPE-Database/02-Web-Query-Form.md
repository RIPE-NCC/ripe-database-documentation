# Web Query Form

The web query form is available at:
https://apps.db.ripe.net/

This is part of the RIPE Database web interface that also includes Webupdates.

The query argument is entered into the form. Many of the query flags can be selected with check boxes. The database source can also be selected this way. If you know the query flags you want, you can also type them into the form with the query argument. If you type some flags and check some others on the form, they will be merged into one set of query flags.

The results are limited to 250 objects. If your query exceeds this, the output is cut short. In this case, either change your query to return fewer results or use another query method.


## Using Full Text Search

If you are looking for a specific piece of information and you don't know one of the values required to find what you are looking for, you may consider using the [Full Text Search](https://apps.db.ripe.net/search/full-text.html) instead of doing a standard query. [Full Text Search](https://apps.db.ripe.net/search/full-text.html) treats the entire database as a flat text file and allows you to search for anything. The search is done on object text without regard for any relationships. As such, results may be very unstructed, but it can provide a good starting point for more specific standard queries later on. Keep in mind that [Full Text Search](https://apps.db.ripe.net/search/full-text.html) is only available on the RIPE NCC website and not in other methods to query the RIPE Database.
