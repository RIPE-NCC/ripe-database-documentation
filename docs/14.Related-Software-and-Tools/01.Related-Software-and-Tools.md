### Reset a lost MD5 maintainer password

If you lost your MD5 password, you can use [this form](../How-to-Recover-Access-to-a-Maintainer-Object/#how-to-recover-access-to-a-maintainer-mntner-object) to request a reset. It requires you to log in with your [RIPE NCC Access (SSO) account](https://www.ripe.net/participate/member-support/ripe-ncc-access/ripe-ncc-access), which you can create if you don't have one yet. If possible, the process should be completely automated, but in some cases it may require intervention from a Customer Services representative. Please note that our policy is to replace a lost MD5 password with a RIPE NCC Access (SSO) account, as this is more secure and allows you to reset a lost password seamlessly in the future.
