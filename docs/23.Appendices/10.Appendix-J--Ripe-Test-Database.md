# Appendix J- RIPE Test Database

## Introduction

The RIPE NCC has a test database where users may learn how to use the software. This database uses the same software as 
the RIPE Database, but is completely separate. You cannot change anything in the RIPE Database by changing an object in the TEST database.

The data in the TEST database is not a copy of the data in the RIPE Database. Also, it is not authoritative data. No 
value should be put on the data in the TEST database. The database is reset to a default state each night.

You can create objects in the TEST database to simulate a part of your real network. You can then experiment with different 
situations in this TEST environment safely.


## Creating Objects in the TEST Database

There are different ways to create objects in the TEST database

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web interface | For creating a single object using a form. Go to  <br/> https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/#/webupdates/select <br/> To get started, create a role and maintainer pair. Go to  <br/> https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/TEST/role/self |
| Mailupdates   | Email you object to test-dbm@ripe.net. You will receive an acknowledgement message with the result.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Syncupdates   | For creating one or more objects at a time, using a single field to edit objects. Go to https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates  You can also submit updates from the command line (or script) via: https://syncupdates-test.db.ripe.net/              |
| REST API      | Software API to create a single object at a time.  Documented in [whois rest api](../Update-Methods/RESTful-API/#ripe-database-restful-api). The base URL for the TEST environment is https://rest-test.db.ripe.net/test                                           |


## Finding Objects in the TEST Database

There are different ways to find objects in the TEST database

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web interface | Go to https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Command line  | Do <br/>```whois -h whois-test.ripe.net <Search String>``` <br/> e.g. <br/>``` whois -h whois-test.ripe.net PB3-RIPE ``` <br/> The query flags that work in the RIPE Database also work in the TEST Database.  We invite you to try them. |
| REST API      | Software API to search Whois or lookup a single object. Documented in [whois rest api](../Update-Methods/RESTful-API/#ripe-database-restful-api)                                                                                          |


## MNTNER Objects in the TEST Database

You can create your own **mntner** objects in the TEST database. This **mntner** object only maintains objects in 
the TEST database.

These are different ways to create a mntner object in the TEST database.

|               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web interface | To create a single object (choose mntner from the dropdown):  <br/> (a) Go to https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/select <br/> (b) Choose mntner from the dropdown and click Create <br/> (c) Complete the form and click Submit                         |
| REST API      | Software API to create, update or delete a single object. Documented in [whois rest api](../Update-Methods/RESTful-API/#ripe-database-restful-api)                                                                                                                      |
| Mailupdates   | (a) complete (fill in) a **mntner** [object template](../RPSL-Object-Types/Descriptions-of-Secondary-Objects/#description-of-the-mntner-object) <br/> (b) email the completed template to test-dbm@ripe.net. <br/> (c) You will receive an email reply with the result. |

There are some RIPE NCC maintainers in the TEST database which can be used for authentication.

|                 |                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TEST-DBM-MNT    | Maintainer for TEST DBM objects. The maintainer password is "emptypassword" without the quotes. |
| TEST-NCC-HM-MNT | Hostmaster maintainer. The maintainer password is "emptypassword" without the quotes.           |


## Creating INETNUM Allocations in the TEST Database

For this example, use the [web interface](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/select) to create an inetnum. 

If you did not create your own **mntner** object, please use TEST-NCC-HM-MNT as the **mntner** of the inetnum.

After typing in the **inetnum** field value, you will be prompted to choose a **mntner** to authenticate the update 
operation. Choose TEST-DBM-MNT and deselect the checkmark that says "Also authorise my RIPE NCC Access account for 
this maintainer".

For example, create an inetnum with a /21 prefix in the 2/8 range.

The "org:" (organisation) attribute is required for an **inetnum** object with the status 'ALLOCATED PA' or 'ALLOCATED 
PI'. The mntner password for the organisation "mnt-ref:" attribute must be known in order to make a reference to the organisation. 
The organisation object must have an "org-type:" attribute with the value 'LIR' for the 'ALLOCATED PA' status 
(for example, use ORG-EIPB1-TEST as an LIR and authenticate with the TEST-DBM-MNT password).


## Creating AUT-NUM Objects in the TEST Database

Aut-num objects in the RIPE database are only assigned by the RIPE NCC. However, you are free to create aut-num objects 
in the TEST database.

You can create an aut-num object from [create an Object](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/select) 
page.

You can also create an aut-num object using the [Syncupdates](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates).

You need to authenticate with the TEST-DBM-MNT password, which maintains the root as-block object.


## Creating Route Objects

For this example, use the [web interface](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/TEST/role/self) 
to create a pair role and maintainer.

You need to [create an LIR organisation](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/TEST/organisation) as well. Normally LIR organisations are created by the RIPE NCC for a member.
Only an LIR organisation can be referenced from an allocation. Use your newly created role (e.g TR1-TEST) as the 
admin-c and tech-c. Use your newly created mntner (e.g. TESTMNT-MNT) as the mnt-by.

You can also create the organisation using the [Syncupdates](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates).
e.g.:
```
organisation:    AUTO-1
org-name:        Test Organisation
org-type:        LIR
address:        Amsterdam
e-mail:         eshryane@ripe.net
admin-c:         TR1-TEST
tech-c:          TR1-TEST
mnt-ref:         TESTMNT-MNT
mnt-by:          TEST-NCC-HM-MNT
mnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT
source:          TEST
password: emptypassword
```

After creating the organisation you need to [create an allocation](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/TEST/inetnum). Normally the allocations are created by the RIPE 
NCC for a member organisation. You need some address space before creating a route object. Use your new organisation
(e.g. ORG-TO2-TEST) as your "org:" reference

You can also create the allocation using the [Syncupdates](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates).
e.g.:
``` 
inetnum:         11.0.0.0 - 11.0.0.255
netname:         NL-TEST
country:         NL
org:               ORG-TO2-TEST
admin-c:         TR1-TEST
tech-c:          TR1-TEST
status:          ALLOCATED PA
mnt-by:     TEST-NCC-HM-MNT
mnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT
source:          TEST
password: emptypassword
```

Finally, you can [create the route object](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/TEST/route) in the address space that you have just allocated.

You can also create the route object using the [Syncupdates](https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates).
e.g.:
``` 
route:           11.0.0.0/24
origin:          AS3333
descr:           route
mnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT
source:          TEST
```
