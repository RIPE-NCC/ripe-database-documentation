# Database Working Group

The Database Working Group deals with all issues related to the RIPE Database. Changes of existing objects, creation of new objects and features, and distribution of databases and security issues are discussed here.
[Join the Working Group](https://www.ripe.net/participate/ripe/wg/active-wg/db)

## Working Group Minutes

The Database Working Group meets at most RIPE Meetings. The minutes of these meetings are archived. Earlier minutes
are part of the general RIPE minutes available as RIPE Documents from the [RIPE Document Store](https://www.ripe.
net/publications/docs). Starting with RIPE 25, the RIPE minutes only contain a short overview of the individual
Working Group sessions. The [full minutes](#minutes-from-the-ripe-database-working-group) are available on this site.

## Minutes from the RIPE Database Working Group

While much of the work of this working group takes place on a dedicated mailing list, the RIPE Database Working Group gathers at RIPE Meetings.

The RIPE NCC, as secretariat for the RIPE community minutes these meetings which are usually made available shortly after a meeting ends.

If you have comments on the content of the minutes, please contact the [working group chairs](mailto:db-wg-chairs@ripe.net). If you have comment on 
the content, please contact the [RIPE NCC webmaster](mailto:webmaster@ripe.net).

## RIPE Database Projects

In order to facilitate an ordered discussion about issues and solutions, as well as report on the progress made with solution implementation, the RIPE Database Working Group employs the following process using Numbered Work Items (NWIs):

* Kickstart: <br> To kickstart the process, any db-wg participant can email the chairs with a snippet of text (a rough 
  problem statement) and formally ask the chairs to make it a work item. The chairs can then say “yes”, and assign it a number, or “no”. If a number is assigned, the work item will be routed through the following three phases:
  * Phrase 1: Problem Definition<br> 
    In this phase we will work as a group on formulating an exact problem 
    definition: text goes back and forth in the working group, example cases of the problem are provided. 
    In a timeframe of two to three weeks the chairs declare consensus on the problem statement of the NWI.<br>
    **Phase 1 output:** A clearly defined problem statement, or a conclusion if we cannot agree upon a problem 
    statement definition. If the latter is true, the NWI cannot proceed to Phase 2.
  * Phrase 2: Solution Definition<br> 
    Solution finding: People can propose solutions to a work item's problem statement. Solutions can come from RIPE 
    NCC staff or from any working group member. The RIPE NCC may offer an implementation analysis on proposed solutions or aspects of solutions.<br>
    For the NWI to move to Phase 3, the RIPE NCC has to provide the working group with a summary of their understanding of the solution, and the chairs declare consensus on the group's acceptance of this summary.
  * Phrase 3: Development and Deployment Phase<br>
    The RIPE NCC writes the code, sets timelines and milestones and documents the transitions/migration plan if 
    applicable.
* Finish: <br>
  The project ends when the change has been deployed in the production environment.
* Cancelled: <br>
  The project can also end when the working group decides to cancel it.

## WG Chair Biographies

[Contact Database Working Group Chair(s)](mailto:db-wg-chairs@ripe.net)

### William Sylvester

William has over 25 years of experience as an executive of core Internet infrastructure, including working for Network Solutions/VeriSign on the InterNIC project. This project involved Internet numbering, domain names, and directory services and resulted in the creation of the Regional Internet Registries (RIR). Currently, William is Senior Vice-President of Addrex, Inc., the pioneer in the market for IPv4 number blocks. He has spent the past ten years collaborating with global communities to help the Internet to keep growing while we work on adopting IPv6.

William has served as the chair of the RIPE Accountability Task Force, helping to document, review, and publish the findings for the RIPE community's accountability post-IANA transition. Now, as the co-chair of the RIPE Database Working Group, William has led the working group forward, removing roadblocks that have existed for many years and undertaking initiatives to clean up the RIPE database.

### Denis Walker

Denis Walker graduated in Physics (1977) and obtained his postgraduate diploma in (Internet) Software Technology (1998). He started as a Software Developer at Ferranti (1978). He worked on real time command and control systems for civil and military defence, and later moved on through several companies including ICL, HP, BT (X.25) and Computer Science departments at universities in Manchester and Liverpool. He spent a number of years as a freelance IT consultant. He made a fortune working as a consultant, invested it all in a side business renting out building equipment, went (technically not legally) bankrupt, and started again with nothing. During his years in IT, he has worked on machines of all sizes, from micros to minis to mainframes that you could walk inside of. Even “real” computers with flashing lights, spinning magnetic tapes and 5MB disk drives the size of a washing machine, all in air conditioned rooms.

Denis started working for the RIPE NCC in 2001 until 2015. Initially as a Software Engineer, then Technical Analyst, for the RIPE Database. Over the years he took a holistic view of the RIPE Database. Denis was involved in software design, development, testing for the RIPE Database and related services, plus policy implementation, legal, training, documentation, and support. He was involved in two major rewrites of the software in 2004 and 2012 and has written many articles for RIPE Labs on database issues. If it was related to the RIPE Database, he had a hand in it.

Now he is (semi) retired but still keeps up to date with all database developments and ideas. He likes to keep his finger in the pie. Denis was one of the early RIPE NCC Certified Professionals for the RIPE Database. He became co-chair for the Database Working Group in December 2016 and is still passionate about all things related to the RIPE Database.
