# Database Business Rules

**The RIPE Database contains objects formatted according to the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL), which has a set of syntax rules you have to comply with when creating, updating or deleting objects. In addition, the RIPE NCC enforces certain business rules to ensure data integrity and registry accuracy. This document gives an overview of all current business rules.**

| **Applies To Object Type**           | **On Action**  | **Business Rule**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **all**                              | Create         | An object cannot be created if it already exists. The creation will fail if another object of the same type and with the same primary key is already present in the RIPE Database.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **all**                              | Create, Update | Only the RIPE NCC is authorised to add or remove RIPE NCC maintainers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **all**                              | Create, Update | On objects where the "language:" or "country:" attribute is used, the value must be a valid [two-letter ISO 3166 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **all**                              | Create, Update | When creating or updating an object in the RIPE Database, all references to other objects must exist, such as **mntner**, **person** and **role** objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **all**                              | Create, Update | A warning is displayed if the object refers to a **person** or **role** object that does not have a maintainer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **all**                              | Create, Update | A warning is displayed if the maintainer that is used for the object refers to a **person** or **role** object that does not have a maintainer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **all**                              | Create, Update | Comments are not allowed in the "source:" attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **all**                              | Delete         | An object can only be deleted if the submitted object matches exactly the current object in the RIPE Database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **all**                              | Delete         | If an object has a RIPE NCC maintainer as one of the maintainers, the object can only be deleted by RIPE NCC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **all**                              | Delete         | An object can only be deleted if it is no longer referenced. An exception to this rule is made for aut-num objects. They may be deleted even if references in "import:" and "export:" attributes exist. </br> When an aut-num object is deleted, a warning email is automatically sent to all maintainers of objects that still reference the associated AS Number. |
| **all**                              | Create, Update | The "mnt-routes:" attribute refers to a maintainer, followed by an optional list of prefix ranges inside of curly braces, or the keyword "ANY". It is not allowed to have the "ANY" value on every "mnt-routes:" attribute in the object.                                                                                                                           |
| **inetnum, inet6num**                | Update         | On Provider Independent address space assignments, the End User maintainer cannot be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **inetnum, inet6num**                | Create         | **inet(6)num** objects cannot overlap, meaning two objects that cover the same range and have the same status cannot exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **inetnum, inet6num**                | Update         | On an **inetnum** object with the status "ALLOCATED PA" or "ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA", the RIPE NCC has specified a "mnt-lower:" attribute. It cannot be removed and another "mnt-lower:" attribute cannot be added. The same applies to an **inet6num** object with the status "ALLOCATED-BY-RIR".                                                                    |
| **inetnum, inet6num**                | Create, Update | When submitting a **route** object that is authorised by a "mnt-routes:" attribute on a matching **inet(6)num** object, the prefix should be within the same range as the one in the submitted object.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **inetnum, inet6num**                | Create, Update | On **inet(6)num** objects for allocations or End User assignments made by the RIPE NCC, the "org:" attribute is mandatory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **inetnum, inet6num**                | Create, Update | When creating an **inet(6)num** object, the "status:" attribute must be set correctly in relation to surrounding objects. For example, the status "ASSIGNED PA" may only be used if the object is a child of an **inetnum** object with the status "ALLOCATED PA".                                                                                                  |
| **inet6num**                         | Create, Update | When creating or updating an **inet6num** object for an assignment, all first-level children must have the same prefix size. In addition, the assignment size should not be larger than a /128 and not smaller than the prefix length of the parent object.                                                                                                         |
| **inetnum, inet6num, aut-num**       | Update         | If the object has a RIPE NCC maintainer as one of the maintainers, only the RIPE NCC can change the value of the "org:" attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **inetnum, inet6num, aut-num**       | Create, Update | Only the RIPE NCC can add, change or remove the "sponsoring-org:" attribute. It must reference an organisation of type "LIR".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **organisation**                     | Create, Update | The "abuse-c:" attribute must reference a **role** object that has an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Once set, the attribute cannot be removed if the organisation is referenced by any object that has a RIPE NCC maintainer present.                                                                                                                                 |
| **organisation**                     | Create, Update | In an **organisation** object, only the value "OTHER" can be used for the "org-type:" attribute. Only the RIPE NCC can use other org-types, such as "LIR".                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **organisation**                     | Update         | If the **organisation** object has a RIPE NCC maintainer present, only the RIPE NCC can change the value of the "org-name:" attribute after an LIR submits a change request. In addition, LIRs cannot change the "e-mail:", "phone:", and "fax-no:" value; these must be changed in the LIR Portal.                                                                 |
| **role**                             | Create, Update | When creating a **role** object that has an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute specified, or adding this attribute to an existing **role** object, a warning is displayed that no rate limiting is applied to this attribute.                                                                                                                                               |
| **role**                             | Update, Delete | The "abuse-mailbox:" attribute cannot be removed from a **role** object if it's referenced as an "abuse-c:" attribute in any **organisation** object.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **role**                             | Create, Update | The "admin-c:" and "tech-c:" of a **role** object cannot refer to itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
