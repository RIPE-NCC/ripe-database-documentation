# Installation and Development

The **RIPE Database** software is available for organisations and developers who wish to install, operate, or extend their own instance of the service. Running a local installation can support development, testing, research, or operational use cases such as mirroring. The software is designed to reflect the behaviour and validation rules of the authoritative RIPE Database service.

This section provides guidance on setting up the required environment, installing the software components, and configuring a working instance of the **RIPE Database**. It also outlines the development workflow, including building the source code, running tests, and contributing changes.
