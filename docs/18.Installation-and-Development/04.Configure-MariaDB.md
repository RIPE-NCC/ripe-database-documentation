# Configure MariaDB

Installing a MariaDB server is useful for development, or for running your own Whois server.

## Configuration

Set the following variables in the MariaDB configuration (location varies depending on installation, the configuration file is normally called my.cnf).

### Development machine
If MariaDB was installed through brew on an Apple Silicon machine, new configuration files can be added under `/opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf.d/`.

Add the following configuration (e.g. in `ripedb.cnf`):
```
[server]
default-time-zone=+00:00
innodb_file_per_table = OFF
max_connections=1000
```

### Running your own Whois server
If you wish to run your own Whois server, you need additional variables to be modified:

* `max_allowed_packet = 20M`
  * We need big packet sizes as some objects are very big
  * Default is 1M 
  * Ref. https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/server-system-variables/#max_allowed_packet

* `innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G`
  * as we only have innodb databases, this should be set to use all the remaining memory available
  * leave some memory for the OS, and the Whois Java process, and check for swap activity
  * default is 128MB
  * Ref. https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size

Restart MariaDB once all configuration changes have been made.

## Configure access to the database

* Check if MariaDB is running `mysqladmin -u root -p ping`
* Login to MariaDB using `mysql -u root -p` (or `mysql` with the default setup)
* Create users:

``` sql
CREATE USER 'dbint'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbint'@'localhost';

CREATE USER 'rdonly'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';
GRANT SELECT PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'rdonly'@'localhost';
```
  
Logout with `CTRL+D`
