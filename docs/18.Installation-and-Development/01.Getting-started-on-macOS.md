# Getting Started on macOS
It is recommended to use [Brew](http://brew.sh) for quick installation of required binaries.

## Java
### Installation
Install OpenJDK 17 or higher.

#### Using [Brew](http://brew.sh)
* Run `brew install openjdk`

#### Manually
* Download and manually install OpenJDK from https://adoptium.net/

Make sure after installation that running `java -version` reports the correct Java version.

### Multiple Java versions
If you have multiple Java versions installed, ensure that you have `$JAVA_HOME` set, and that the `$PATH` contains `$JAVA_HOME/bin`.

## Maven
Maven can be installed through [Brew](http://brew.sh): run `brew install maven`

## Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) can be installed via Apple's Xcode Command Line Tools or Brew.

If Brew is installed, Git should already be installed, as it requires Apple's Xcode Command Line Tools.

### Git Bash completion (optional)
Bash can complete Git commands, but it needs additional setup.

#### Using [Brew](http://brew.sh)
The Git formulae ships Git's bash completion:
* Run `brew install git`

bash-completion is required for bash completion to work. Depending on which bash is used, a different formulae must be installed:
* For Homebrew's `bash` (>= v4): Run `brew install bash-completion@2`
* For macOS's `bash` (v3.2.57): Run `brew install bash-completion`

Read the formulae's caveats for instructions on how to activate bash-completion by adding a line in your `.bash_profile`.

## MariaDB

### Installation
The easiest way of installing MariaDB is through [Brew](http://brew.sh): run `brew install mariadb`

### Configuration
[Configure MariaDB](../Installation-and-Development/Configure-MariaDB/#configure-mariadb)
