[Configure MariaDB](03-Configure-MariaDB.md#configure-mariadb)

## Prepare /export directory

Some tests need /export directory to be readable/writable by your user:

  sudo mkdir /export
  sudo chown YOUR_USERNAME /export


> Note that since Catalina, it is not possible to directly create directories under `/` as it is now read only. See this [guide](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/creating-root-level-directories-and-symbolic-links-on-macos-catalina/) on how to create `/export`
