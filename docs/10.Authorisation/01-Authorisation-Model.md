# Authorization Model

The **mntner** objects serve as anonymous containers that hold authorization credentials. A reference to a **mntner** object within any object defines authorization necessary to perform operations on that object or on a set of related objects. Such reference is provided by means of several attributes including "mnt-by:", "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:", "mnt-domains:", "mnt-ref:" and "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.

The **mntner** object contains one or more mandatory "auth:" attributes. Each attribute begins with a keyword identifying the authorization method followed by the authorization information or token needed to enforce that method. The irt object also has mandatory “auth:” attributes used for authorization.

All updates require authorization. A credential that is valid for one of the authorization tokens of one of the relevant **mntner** objects, must be supplied. Different methods of authorization require different authorization tokens, as shown in the table below of authorization methods that are currently supported.

| **Authorization Method** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| MD5-PW | This scheme is based on the MD5 hash algorithm. The authorization information stored in the database is a passphrase, encrypted using md5-crypt algorithm, which is a concatenation of the "$1$" string, the salt, and the 128-bit hash output. Because it uses an eight-character salt, a passphrase of almost unlimited length and the encrypted hash is hidden from public view, this scheme is quite stable against dictionary attacks.<br><br>Example:<br><br>auth: MD5-PW $1$abcd4321$HyM/GVhPqXkkIMVerxxQ3z |
| PGPKEY | This is a strong form of authorization. The authorization information is a signature identity pointing to a public key certificate, which is stored in a separate **key-cert** object. The update is authorized if the transaction is signed by the corresponding private key. The RIPE NCC does not guarantee that a key belongs to any specific entity. Anyone can supply any public keys, with any ownership information, to the RIPE Database. These keys can be used to protect other objects by checking that the update comes from a user who knows the corresponding secret key. The database software only allows current keys (that have not expired) to sign an update message, and signed messages are only valid for one hour.<br><br>Example:<br><br>auth: PGPKEY-1380K9U1 |
| SSO | This scheme is based on the RIPE NCC Access single sign-on (SSO) system. It takes the management of these authorization tokens outside of the RIPE Database. The authorization tokens are managed by the RIPE NCC Access software. To use this, you must first create an account with [RIPE NCC Access](https://access.ripe.net/).<br><br>The SSO system was introduced so that when somebody signs in once with RIPE NCC Access, that account authorizes them to use certain services that support it, such as Webupdates or the Syncupdates web form.<br><br>The credential in the **mntner** object uses the keyword SSO followed by the email address used to sign in to your SSO account. You can add many different SSO credentials to a **mntner** object and add your SSO credential to as many **mntner** objects as you wish (provided you have authority to update each **mntner** object using existing authorization). If you change your email address in your RIPE NCC Access preferences, this will immediately be reflected in any **mntner** objects where this access account is referenced.<br><br>Authorization using SSO can be done from Webupdates and the Syncupdates web form. You can sign into your RIPE NCC Access account directly from Webupdates and Syncupdates. Using any of the update features from Webupdates/Syncupdates you can create, modify and delete objects. No password is needed - you are already authenticated and authorized to make these updates, assuming the object(s) are maintained by one of your SSO **mntner** objects.<br><br>Example:<br><br>auth: SSO dbtest \_at\_ ripe \_dot\_ net |
