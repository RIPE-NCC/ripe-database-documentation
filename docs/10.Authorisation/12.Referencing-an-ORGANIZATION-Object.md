# Referencing an ORGANISATION Object

The **organisation** object can be referenced in any object. This reference is made by adding an optional "org:" attribute to the referencing object, along with the name of the **organisation** object. Adding this reference requires authorisation from the **organisation** object. Authorisation can be approved by any of the **mntner** objects referenced in any of the "mnt-ref:" attributes of the **organisation** object. The authorisation will not default to the "mnt-by:" attributes if no suitable maintainer is found in the "mnt-ref:" attributes and, in this case, the update will fail.

Authorisation from the **organisation** object is only required when an "org:" attribute is added to a referencing object, either on creation or by modification. This is in addition to the authorisation of the referencing object itself.
