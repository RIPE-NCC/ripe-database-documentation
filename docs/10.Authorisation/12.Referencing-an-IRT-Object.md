# Referencing an IRT Object

The **irt** object can be referenced in **inetnum** and **inet6num** objects. This reference is made by adding an optional "mnt-irt:" attribute to the **inet(6)num** object with the value set to the name of the **irt** object. Adding a reference to an **irt** object requires authorisation from the **irt** object. Authorisation can be approved by any of the credentials referenced in any of the "auth:" attributes of the **irt** object. The authorisation will not default to the "mnt-by:" attributes of the **irt** object if no suitable credential is found in the "auth:" attributes, and, in this case, the update will fail.

Authorisation from the **irt** object is only required when a "mnt-irt:" attribute is added to a referencing object, either on creation or by modification. The **irt** authorisation is required in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself.
