# Protecting Membership of a Set

When membership of a set is specified through the use of the "member-of:" attribute, the server checks the validity of the membership when creating or modifying a member object. This "member-of:" attribute can be used in **route(6)**, **aut-num** and **inet-rtr** objects. The value of the "member-of:" attribute identifies a **set** object that this object wants to be a member of.

The **set** object may also have a related "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute, listing the maintainer of the object that wants to be a member of the **set**. The membership claim 
of an object with a "member-of:" attribute must be validated. Validation occurs by matching a "mnt-by:" attribute of the object with one of the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes 
of the **set** object. If the claim is not valid at the time of creation or modification of a member object (**route(6)**, **aut-num** or **inet-rtr**), the operation
fails. If a **set** object has no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the **set** is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes in the **set** object. In this case, no other 
object can validate a claim to be a member of this **set**. Below is an example of "member-of:" usage:

    aut-num:     as3333
    member-of:   as-ripe
    mnt-by:      ripe-dbm-mnt

    as-set:      as-ripe
    mbrs-by-ref: ripe-dbm-mnt
