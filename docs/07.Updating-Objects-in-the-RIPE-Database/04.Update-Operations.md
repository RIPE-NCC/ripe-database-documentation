# Update Operations

There are three update operations that can be performed on an object:

* create
* modify
* delete

The create and modify share a lot in common. Initially, when an object is presented by either email or Syncupdates, the database software has to decide if the object already exists or not. If it exists, the operation is modify. If it does not exist the operation is create. This issue can be forced with the use of the keyword ‘NEW'. If this keyword is included then the operation is set as create. If the object already exists, it will be an error. An existing object will never be updated when this keyword is included in the update. For email updates, this keyword will be in the ‘Subject' line. For client-based Syncupdates this keyword is passed as a parameter. It is not possible to use the keyword with the web-based Syncupdates form at:
https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates

The RESTful update method works differently as it follows the standard REST paradigm. If the data is received by a POST method, the ‘NEW' keyword is set and it can only be a create operation. If the data is received by a PUT method it can only be a modify operation. If the method and operation do not match it is an error.

Webupdates uses the RESTful API as the update method. So it must also follow the REST paradigm. There are additional checks at the Webupdates form level to ensure the right method is used.

If the operation is modify and the supplied object data is identical to the existing object stored in the database, allowing for white space variations, then the object is not modified. This is considered to be a successful ‘NO OPERATION'.

The delete operation is the same no matter what update method is used. The full version of the object must be 
supplied exactly as it is stored in the database. The supplied version is checked against the stored version by 
compressing the white spaces and doing a string comparison. If they don't match, the delete operation fails. If you 
query for the object before supplying the query result in a delete operation, make sure you use the correct query 
flags to avoid any filtering of the returned object. See section on [Filtering Query Output](../Types-of-Queries/Filtering-the-Query-Reponse/#filtering-the-query-response) for more details.

To delete an object, there must be no references to it from any other object in the database. A single reference will prevent it from being deleted. Note, however, that not all attributes containing primary keys of other objects are hard references. The routing policy attributes in an **aut-num** object can list other AS Numbers but these are not considered as references for the delete operation.

For the RESTful API and also Webupdates, the delete method is used. For mail and Syncupdates the pseudo attribute "delete: some reason text" must be added to the object data. As these update methods allow multiple objects in an update message, this pseudo-attribute must be part of the object itself to ensure a strong association with this pseudo-attribute and a specific object. Each object that is to be deleted must have a "delete:" pseudo attribute attached to it. It can be added at any point within the object or immediately before or after the object.

Objects can still be deleted from the database even if they are not syntactically correct. This allows for old objects to be deleted long after the syntax has been changed. If the object was to be modified, any syntax errors would need to be corrected.

Following [Acceptable use policy](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/support/documentation/ripe-database-acceptable-use-policy/), we strive to detect 
potential attacks. If a DoS attack is detected, we temporarily block the user's IP address. 

[The RIPE Database Terms and Conditions](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/support/documentation/ripe-database-acceptable-use-policy/)
allow the RIPE NCC to block or suspend access to the RIPE Database services for any suspected abuse. Users exhibiting 
suspected abusive behavior may be permanently blocked from the system. If a user is permanently blocked, they will receive a notification 
informing them of the block whenever they attempt to make an update.

If you wish to be unblocked, please contact the RIPE Database administration team [ripe-dbm@ripe.net](mailto:ripe-dbm@ripe.net) to discuss further.
