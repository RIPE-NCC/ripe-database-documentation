# Historical Data

Every time an object is updated in the RIPE Database, the old version is saved. A standard query will always return the most recent version. The old versions are available by using the history query flags. See the section on [Querying Historical Data](../Types-of-Queries/Historical-Queries/#historical-queries) for more details. Personal historical data is not available.
