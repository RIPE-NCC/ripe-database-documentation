# RIPE Database Documentation

VuePress documentation for RIPE Database Documentation.

This repo contains the documentation from [Database Documentation webpage](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/support/documentation/ripe-database-documentation). This documentation is built automatically from nothing more than markdown files in the tree.

# Updating Documentation

We welcome updates to the documentation. Please open a pull request with your changes, or create an issue.

# VuePress

This project depends on VuePress (https://vuepress.vuejs.org) to build the static site from Markdown.

The VuePress configuration and components are not yet public, so are not included for now.

# License

The documentation is covered by the terms of the [license](LICENSE.md).
